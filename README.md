# PSQLApp
Work in progress.  
Program that connects to and updates a local school/tuition PSQL-database. Programmed using DAO-patterns.  
The idea is to make this into an app that can track payments for students and notify when they are due.  
And allow end-user to have control over classes, students and payments.

Code used for the database design in *database.sql* file


**Learned so far:** JDBC, database design, DAO programming pattern, injection attacks
